-----Commuication------
The above given script communicates from node to python
When you run main.js it converts test image(Capture.PNG) to base64
and automatically calls python script which reconverts encoded string to image.

To work with script you have to keep main.js and python in same folder
Because main.js writes base64 string in a .txt file and calls python script 
Python script then reads that .txt file to receive that base64 string and convert into image.


-----UPDATE-----
Soon a script will be uploaded that will no longer have the limitation of placing
main.js and python script in tha same folder.
